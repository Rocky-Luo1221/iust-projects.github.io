### About Erfan

My name is Erfan Miahi, and I am striving to become a machine learning researcher.

Well. It all began at the end of 2016. I found my beloved field of research: Artificial Intelligence (AI). Since then, I am trying to expand my knowledge about this field by all the means that I can get: participating in research projects; reading cool books; implementing wonderful algorithms; and so on and so forth. Besides, one particular question has been occupying my mind: what we mean by intelligence?!
