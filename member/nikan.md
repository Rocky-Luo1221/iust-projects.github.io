I am a master degree student of computer engineering at the Iran University of Science and Technology.
I started my career in AI by studying about Evolutionary Algorithms, like Genetics and I have implemented a paper about using genetics to optimize Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem.
Then, I started learning about machine learning and deep learning on my own through self-study using online videos from different universities. And now I am researching about my ideas.

I love teaching and had many presentations about different topics in almost all undergraduate courses. And Also, I usually contribute to Open Source community couple of times a week.

Furthermore, I love communicating with people to know more and exchange information. This helps me a lot to understand better.

Finally, Reinforcement Learning is the top-1 topic I want to do some research.
