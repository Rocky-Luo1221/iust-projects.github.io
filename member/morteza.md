### About me

I am a computer engineering (CE) Ph.D. student at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Tehran, Iran. 
My research interests are empirical and automated software engineering (EaASE), especially automated software refactoring, testing, and debugging, static and dynamic software analysis, and applying machine learning in software engineering. 
Currently, I am a member of the IUST Reverse Engineering Research Laboratory, where I am working under the supervision of Dr. Saeed Parsa on advanced software engineering topics, including refactoring and testing.
