### Computer Performance and Evaluation

**Computer performance** is the efficiency of a given computer system, or how well the computer performs, when taking all aspects into account. A **computer performance evaluation** is defined as the process by which a computer system's resources and outputs are assessed to determine whether the system is performing at an optimal level. It is similar to a voltmeter that a handyman may use to check the voltage across a circuit. The meter verifies that the correct voltage is passing through the circuit. Similarly, an assessment can be done on a PC using established benchmarks to see if it is performing correctly.<a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/computer-performance-evaluation-definition-challenges-parameters.html" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>
